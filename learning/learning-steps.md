# 🛠️ Here's What I Recommend

## 1. Practice Variants of This Pattern Without Giving It Away
Keep doing what has been started:

DSA question in interviewer style.
Make it vague, like real interviews do.
Try to solve it — not by pattern matching, but by figuring out the underlying math.

## 2. Reflect Right After Each Problem
Ask:

- "What was the core trick here?"
- "What kind of math idea was hidden?"
- "What were the signals that I should have noticed?"

This strengthens pattern detection, not just memory.

## 3. Weekly or Biweekly Re-visits
Come back to a problem like this 7–14 days later.
If you can recognize it then? That means it’s sticking.
