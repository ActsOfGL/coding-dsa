# 🧭 Best Path Forward: Hybrid Rebuild Plan

Here’s what I recommend, tailored to your current state:
1. Mini Deque Refresher (1–2 small drills)
    🔁 To rebuild your mental model of sliding window + monotonic deque

    These will be simple scenarios where you must maintain the window max or min as the window slides. No traps. Just reps to get back that intuition.

2. Warm-up DSA Interview Variant (Easy → Medium)
    🎯 Light pressure, interview style, disguised pattern (you guess and adapt)

    Example: "Given a list of integers, find the length of the longest subarray where the absolute difference between any two elements is at most k."
    (Your job: recognize it's a sliding window + max-min variation — without being told.)

3. Retro DSA Review (Previously failed ones)
    🔁 Targeting problems where mental block was strong before (e.g., DSAa0025–28, or deque front cleanup)

    We go back to those exact problems, re-derive the logic together from scratch, then rebuild the code live.

4. Gradual Return to New DSA Patterns
    🧠 Like Monotonic Stack with Intervals, Range Queries, Tree DP, etc.

    Once confidence returns, we’ll pick up new patterns and compound your learning.


===========================================================

## 🧱 Phase 1: Recalibrate the Foundation (Sliding Window + Monotonic Deque)
    Goal: Master subarray patterns with min/max range control.

    [🔁 Warm-up] Count max-length subarray where max - min <= k

        ✅ You've attempted this.
        📍Next: walk through 2–3 different examples (I'll generate) with visual deque evolution.

    [🧮 Count all valid subarrays where max - min <= k]

        ✅ You're working through this now.
        📍Next: final walkthrough + edge cases + Rust polishing.
        🎯 Teaches dynamic window resizing and subarray counting logic.

    [🔄 Variation Challenge] Return the shortest valid subarray where max - min <= k]

        Adds a twist: shrinking fast is optimal.
        🎯 Builds intuition for two-pointer + greedy window control.

## 🧠 Phase 2: Strengthen Related Patterns (HashMap + Prefix Sum)

    Goal: Revisit prefix sum and hashmaps through adjacent patterns.

    [🔗 Subarray sum equals k]

        Pattern: prefix sum + hashmap.
        🎯 Refresher for modular arithmetic reasoning.

    [📊 Subarray sum divisible by k with length ≥ X]

        Variation of the above with constraints.
        🎯 Forces you to reason about prefix remainder tracking.

    [🎣 Catch-up Retest] Given disguised prompts from 4–5 above

        I’ll reword previous questions like an interviewer would.
        🎯 Locks the patterns in with long-term memory recall.

## 🚀 Phase 3: Micro-Projects or Drill Days

    Goal: Break from DSA with Rust-focused code sprints.

    [⚙️ Build a Subarray Visualizer CLI in Rust]

        Parses nums input, steps through each iteration of sliding window.
        🎯 Reinforces syntax, ownership, and stack mechanics.

    [📦 Rust practice drill] Write a reusable deque handler

        Handles push/pop for min/max with enums or traits.
        🎯 Boosts confidence in Rust data structure design.

## 🔁 Phase 4: The Mastery Loop (Weekly Rotating Focus)

    Goal: Cement memory through spaced repetition and challenge cycles.

    [🎯 Weekly: 1-2 fresh DSA + 1 retest]

        Each new problem builds from what you’ve learned.
        🎯 You’ll revisit tough concepts from earlier in disguised formats.
