# Observation of the mentor to me:

### 👨‍⚕️ Why This is the Best for You Right Now:

As your coach and mentor, I see this pattern in your situation:
  - You retain key concepts (like prefix sums, hashmaps, and DSA logic), but:
  - You hesitate or freeze slightly when it’s time to express the full Rust code — especially after time away.
  - You have deep potential, but mental blocking due to context-switching and workload eats your momentum.
  - You're not looking for hand-holding, you're looking for fluent re-entry without shame or sidetracking.

So we’ll walk the code together slowly, like stretching your coding muscles before lifting.

### 🛠️ This helps you:
✅ Rebuild confidence
✅ Re-anchor the Rust syntax
✅ Lower the pressure before writing solo
✅ Maintain forward motion even if you return tomorrow
