## This repo shall help the developer to understand DSA by solving and implementing through code



### The repo shall accept any coding language but by default, it's currently using Rust

# ðŸ“˜ DSA Interview Practice in Rust

This project is a curated archive of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems solved using idiomatic Rust. Each problem is structured like a real MAANG-style interview, gradually increasing in complexity to help build intuition and pattern recognition for technical interviews.

---

### ðŸ§© More Coming Soon...
Next challenges will build from these patterns to introduce sliding windows, prefix sums, two pointers, and more â€” leading up to hard-level problems.

---

## ðŸ¦€ Why Rust?
Rust forces strict ownership and borrowing rules, which helps develop clean logic and tight memory safety â€” all while building interview-ready problem-solving skills.
