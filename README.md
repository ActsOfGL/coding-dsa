## This repo shall help the developer to understand DSA by solving and implementing through code



### The repo shall accept any coding language but by default, it's currently using Rust

# ðŸ“˜ DSA Interview Practice in Rust

This project is a curated archive of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems solved using idiomatic Rust. Each problem is structured like a real MAANG-style interview, gradually increasing in complexity to help build intuition and pattern recognition for technical interviews.

### 5. Has Nearby Divisible Duplicate
- **Difficulty:** Medium  
- **Pattern:** HashMap + Divisibility filter  
- **Description:** Return `true` if there are two equal numbers divisible by a given `divisor` and within a `distance` of `k` between indices.  
- **Function:** `has_nearby_divisible_duplicate(nums: &[i32], distance: i32, divisor: i32) -> bool`

### ðŸ§© More Coming Soon...
Next challenges will build from these patterns to introduce sliding windows, prefix sums, two pointers, and more â€” leading up to hard-level problems.

## ðŸ¦€ Why Rust?
Rust forces strict ownership and borrowing rules, which helps develop clean logic and tight memory safety â€” all while building interview-ready problem-solving skills.
