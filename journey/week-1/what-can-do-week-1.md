# 🧘‍♂️ What You Can Do This Week (No Pressure)

## Here are reflection-focused, low-effort but high-impact activities:
1. Journal-style Reflection
 - What concepts still feel fuzzy?
 - Which patterns are you recognizing more easily?
 - When did you feel stuck, and how did you push through?

2. Code Reviews (Your Own)
 - Pick one or two problems you solved.
 - Re-read your own code like it was written by someone else.
 - Ask: Would I understand this in a month? Could I make this more readable or efficient?

3. Concept Flashcards
 - Create little mental flashcards (or real ones):
 - “What’s the sliding window pattern?”
 - “When do I use prefix sums instead of loops?”
 - “What’s the shape of a monotonic stack solution?”

These build strong mental retrieval cues.

4. Mind-Walk or Rubber-Duck Talk
 - Go for a walk and explain the prefix sum technique out loud, as if teaching it to a rubber duck. You’ll surprise yourself with what you know or need to revisit.


## 📌 Optional: Light, Low-Stakes Practice
 If you get the itch to code:
  - Try revisiting one old problem but refactor it for readability.
  - Recreate it in TypeScript or Python for contrast.
  - Sketch a visual map of how one algorithm flows (e.g., sliding window updates).
