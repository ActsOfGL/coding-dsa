# ðŸŒ± Reflection & Absorption Week

## ðŸ§  What Has been Learned So Far
 Explored and internalized:
  - HashMaps & HashSets and when not to overuse them
  - Stack-based patterns (like Monotonic Stack)
  - Prefix sums and how they unlock efficient subarray logic
  - Sliding window technique and its inner workings
  - Tradeoffs between brute-force and optimized solutions
  - Clean, idiomatic Rust vs. step-by-step verbose logic
  - Algorithmic mindset: building, debugging, and comparing strategies
  - Handling ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes in real-world-style DSA problems
  - Thinking like an engineer: tests, naming, reusability, edge cases
  - Thatâ€™s a lot. Youâ€™ve leveled up in a serious way already.
