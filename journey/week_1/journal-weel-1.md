# 🧠 DSA Reflection & Absorption Week

Welcome to your Reflection Week. Use this to slow down, absorb what you've learned, and revisit your thought processes like a senior dev growing in mastery.

---

## 📅 Week Overview
**Goal:** Reinforce past concepts, clarify fuzzy areas, clean up thinking.

### 🧘‍♂️ Reflection Prompts
- What DSA concepts have I internalized?
- What still feels confusing or inconsistent?
- What patterns am I starting to recognize quicker?
- Where do I tend to overthink or overbuild solutions?

---

## 🛠️ Concepts Reviewed So Far

### ✅ Mastered or Familiar:
- [ ] HashMap/HashSet usage
- [ ] Monotonic Stack (Daily Temperatures-style)
- [ ] Prefix Sum Technique
- [ ] Sliding Window (Fixed-size)
- [ ] Rust ownership & borrowing in DSA
- [ ] Iteration patterns (for, while, ranges)

### ❓ Needs Clarification:
- [ ] When to use prefix sum vs sliding window?
- [ ] How to think in O(1) space vs O(n)?
- [ ] Naming conventions and idiomatic function patterns

## 🧩 Flashcards or Micro-Drills
Use these prompts to quiz yourself or make small review notes.

- What’s the sliding window pattern?
- When do I use prefix sums over a loop?
- How do I detect a subarray divisible by a number?
- How does a monotonic stack work in problems like stock span or daily temperatures?
- What are the O(n) tradeoffs in prefix vs sliding?

---

## 🎯 Stretch Goals (Optional)
- [ ] Recreate a solution in TypeScript
- [ ] Refactor one solution for readability and tests
- [ ] Draw the flow of a DSA algorithm
- [ ] Write pseudocode for a problem you solved earlier

## 💬 Final Reflections This Week
Jot down any ahas, frustrations, or realizations as you go.

> “I realized I default to HashMaps too often…”

> “The moment the prefix sum clicked was when…”
