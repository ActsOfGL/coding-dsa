ðŸ“Œ DSA Problem:  3: Count Subarrays Within Sum Range and Length Constraint

Problem:
Given an array of integers nums, which can include positive, negative, or zero values, and two additional integers, k and min_len, you need to count all the contiguous subarrays whose sum is between k and 2 * k (inclusive) and whose length is at least min_len.

Constraints:

The sum of the subarray must be between k and 2 * k (inclusive).

The subarray must have a length of at least min_len.

The function should aim for an efficient O(n) solution using a sliding window approach.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1, 2, -1, 3, 4], k = 3, min_len = 2
Output: 4
Explanation:
The valid subarrays are:
1. [1, 2] (sum = 3, length = 2)
2. [1, 2, -1, 3] (sum = 5, length = 4)
3. [2, -1, 3] (sum = 4, length = 3)
4. [3, 4] (sum = 7, length = 2)

Example 2:
Input: nums = [5, -1, 3, -2, 6], k = 4, min_len = 3
Output: 2
Explanation:
The valid subarrays are:
1. [5, -1, 3] (sum = 7, length = 3)
2. [-1, 3, -2, 6] (sum = 6, length = 4)
